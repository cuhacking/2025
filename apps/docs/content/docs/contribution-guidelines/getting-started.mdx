### Something needs fixing? Want to add a new feature?

Submit an issue on our project board to get the ball rolling.
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's an issue?">
    A GitHub issue is essentially a task card that denotes **what** is being worked on, and by **whom**.

Issues also act as a discussion thread used to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements. Itâ€™s a way to collaborate with the community to solve problems and add enhancements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I submit an issue?">
Navigate to the [issues tab](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/issues).

Click on the "New Issue" button and fill out the template with the necessary information.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Creating an issue will document the changes that you want to incorporate and will let everyone know what you are working on.

#### Guidelines

- **Title**: ``type(issue-scopes): issue title`` (unless it's an ``[ADR]``).
- **Description**: Follow the issue template and stay problem-specific when writing issues.
- **Labels**: Use labels to categorize the issue. This helps in organizing and prioritizing issues for the project board.
- **Assignees**: Assign the issue to the appropriate person(s) who will be responsible for working on the issue (could be yourself).

Here's an example of a [well-documented issue](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/issues/49).

## Meet System Requirements

Our project is developed on UNIX-based operating systems.

For Windows users, the use of [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is highly encouraged in order to avoid those rare, maddening, a-tiny-part-of-this-one-library-breaks issues that can be very hard to debug.

<Callout type="warn">
  Ubuntu LTS' `apt` package manager is version locked. Use
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) instead to install the latest versions of
  packages.
</Callout>

Using a Git porcelain such as [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is highly encouraged, as it provides a visual [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) to manage your commits, branches, staging areas, stashes, and much more. These are common occurences as we do [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

It's also significantly easier to resolve merge conflicts, cherry-pick commits between branches, squash them, amend a few commits back, checkout a specific commit, stage in hunks, etc.

You'll be able to unlock the full power of Git without having to memorize all the commands.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's a Git Porcelain?">
In strict Git terminology, "porcelain" commands are high-level, user-friendly commands designed for everyday Git operations, such as `git commit`, `git merge`, and `git pull`. These are wrappers for low-level "plumbing" commands, that handle the internal data structures of Git, intended for scripting and advanced manipulation.

In this context, we mean tools such as [these](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) when we say "porcelain".

Porcelain commands simplify Git interaction by abstracting the complexities, making them ideal for regular use by developers.

  <Accordion title="Do I need to switch to the dark side and code in shell?">
    No you don't. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.

## Learn the Fork and Pull Model

The [Fork and Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) is used to merge external contributions into the project.

Fork with all branches to quickly see what someone else is up to.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is a fork?">
    Forking is creating a personal copy of a repository under your own GitHub account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project until youâ€™re ready to submit them.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I fork the repo?">
Click the fork button on the top right of [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025).

[Learn More](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your local machine and set the remote upstream.

Our codebase is constantly changing and evolving. Keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository.

See [Knowledge Base - Learn Git](/knowledge-base#-learn-git) and  for resources.

## Check Project Status

See what we're up to on the project board linked in the navbar. <ProjectBoardIcon />

## Pick an Issue

Comment on an issue on the project board that you're interested in to be assigned, or create one for yourself.

### Resolving open issues

Alternatively, you can also look at the open issues and see if there's anything that you can help with which interests you.

Make sure to let us know that you're interested in working on an issue by commenting on it.

## Create a Branch
Branch from `main` with the following name format:

`yourname/<issue-type>/<issue-number>-<issue-name-kebab-cased>`.

Your branch must be named the same as the issue, without the scopes.

For example, the branch for issue #1 titled 'feat(portal): add login page' would be:

`johndoe/feat/1-add-login-page`.

See [Trunk-Based Development](/contribution-guidelines/trunk-based-development) to learn more.

## Commit Changes with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec

See [Trunk-Based Development](/contribution-guidelines/trunk-based-development) to learn more.
