  Just in case you forgot: Rebasing onto `main` before continuing work is the
  secret to happiness.
</Callout>

Always simple rebase your branch onto main before creating a pull request. This ensures that your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes in the main branch. Branch and PR rules are set up for the repo just in case as a guardrail.

Do your best to close a single issue per pull request, and always use the **same PR title as the issue name**. This makes debugging easier later.

<Callout>
PRs that close multiple issues are generally only done by the core team in times of emergency.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What if this issue blocks the next issue I want to work on?">
Simply create a new branch for that issue from the branch for your current pull request and continue working on the next issue on that branch.

This technique is called [branch stacking](https://medium.com/@lneves12/git-how-to-stack-multiple-git-branches-and-rebase-them-like-a-pro-91c0cdf67ef). With the power of `git rebase`, you can continually apply PR feedback for the first branch while making progress for the next task on the second branch.

Once again, [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) makes this quick and easy to do cleanly.

Be mindful about what you're trying to contribute and the type of contribution.
- Double-check [Branching Guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/branching-guidelines), [Coding Guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/coding-guidelines) and [Commit Conventions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/conventional-commits) before making a PR.
- Use the appropriate template that matches with your branch type.
- Ensure your PR scope and subject align with your commit(s).
- If your code isnâ€™t fully ready to be merged, create a draft PR instead.
- Link PR branches with the according issue (if applicable).
- Ensure PR description is solution-specific (describe only the solution since the issue describes the problem at hand already).

If you're getting tired of storing work in progress by stashing changes or amending commits and then switching branches, it's a great sign to look into using [Git Worktrees](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Use-this-git-worktree-add-example-and-never-switch-branches-again).

Here is an example of a detailed [PR](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/pull/60).

If your issue blows up and splitting it into multiple issues doesn't make sense, keep the issue open and make multiple PRs that complete it in increments, as shown in [Issue #40](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/issues/40).

## What is a CODEOWNER?

Code owners are subject matter experts for specific areas of the codebase.

The relevant person automatically notified and requested to review changes when a pull request affects their area.

See our CODEOWNERS file below for more info:
```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../.github/CODEOWNERS",
    "codeblock": {
    "lang": "ini",
    "meta": "title=\"CODEOWNERS\""
  }
}
```
