## Using Lazygit and Linux/Unix (literally anything \*nix)

For Windows users, the use of [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is highly encouraged in order to avoid those rare, maddening, a-tiny-part-of-this-one-library-breaks issues that can be very hard to debug.

The use of [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is highly encouraged, as it provides a visual [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) to manage your commits, branches, staging areas, stashes, and much more. It is also significantly easier to resolve merge conflicts, cherry-pick commits between branches, squash them, amend a few commits back, checkout a specific commit, stage in hunks, etc. You will be able to unlock the full power of Git without having to memorize all the commands.

TODO: Add demo gif of Lazygit in action

- Branch checkout, pull, push, and rebase
- Commit, amend, re-word, re-order, squash, and cherry-pick
- Staging hunks, lines, and files
- Soft reset, mixed reset, and hard reset
- Named stashes
- Worktrees
- Reflog
- Git command log

    No you don't üòÇ You can simply run WSL in your VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows machine, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically. It's a deadly
    combo. Well done Microsoft üëè
