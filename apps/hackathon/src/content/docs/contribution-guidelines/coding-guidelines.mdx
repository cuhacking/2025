In case we haven't already mentioned it, make sure to rebase onto `main` before continuing work.

We're huge on clean code. Code will be read more than it is written. Thankfully you don't have to memorize all of the conventions, as most of them have been automated by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

If you have the ESLint extension in your IDE, you will immediately see some annoying red and yellow squigglies underneath your code. Thankfully, most of these squigglies can be made to go away using the format command in your IDE, or by running `pnpm lint:fix` in your terminal.

  <Accordion title="But these squigglies are so annoying üò≠ Can I just do `eslint ignore`? ü•∫üëâüëà">
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, they're very annoying, we understand üò´</li>
      <li>We feel tempted to just throw in an `eslint ignore` too. We learned over time that these squigglies are invaluable in ensuring that all code everyone writes follows the same style guide. Following the same conventions also makes migrations and automated codebase re-writes significantly easier using tools such as [codemods](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).</li>
      <li>It's either the squigglies or trying to memorize many pages of documentation on style guides which vary from team to team. Having PRs nitpicked at or argued over by different opinions is also very time consuming. It wears the team down and increases the chances of bugs. Whenever possible, we do our best to automate fixes for the squigglies.</li>
    </ul>

  <Accordion title="The error message isn't helpful, should I google the error or is there a quicker way?">
Googling is great, but the ESLint config inspector is better. Get with the times. It's an interactive solution to find which rules come from which plugins, and hyperlink you to their docs directly.

Simply do `pnpm lint:inspect-open` in your terminal, and you'll see a little web app pop up in your browser. Click around and explore :)

You can also view the `eslint.config.mjs` file to view a list of the presets and plugins we use.

### Refactoring
`Refactoring` is a misleading term, as the `factoring` part needs to happen first.

Let's say we have:

```math
c = x + xy
```

We can make it easier to read by factoring out the `x`:
```math
c = x(1 + y)
```

This is great, and we can go even further:
```math
\begin{align*}
c &= x^2\left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{y}{x}\right) \\
  &= x^3\left(\frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{y}{x^2}\right) \\
  &= x^4\left(\frac{1}{x^3} + \frac{y}{x^3}\right)
\end{align*}
```

Now compare the two equations, which one is easier to understand?

<div className="flex justify-center items-center gap-4">

    ```math
    c = x^4\left(\frac{1}{x^3} + \frac{y}{x^3}\right)
    ```
    
    ```math
    c = x(1 + y)
    ```
</div>

Now take this concept and apply it to code. You'll find that the parallels are uncanny.
