# ui

This is the shared UI library containing both Shadcn/ui and cuHacking/ui primitive components, also known as presentation/dumb components.

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) doesn't yet have an official Storybook.

PR [#1561](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1561) adds support, and work-in-progress stories for components can be found [here](https://github.com/lloydrichards/shadcn-ui/tree/94ee191d989cf93246f2feaca68b1fdb24c18940/apps/www/registry/stories).
