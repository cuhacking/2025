## Introduction

<Callout title="What's Extreme Programming (XP)?">
- A set of rigorous software development practices built on top of the Agile methodology.
- Rapid release cadence over tiny development cycles.
- Emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, and Collective Code Ownership.
</Callout>

### Core Principles

  root((Core Principles))
    Communication
        Constant and open communication between all  developers, designers, PMs and customers
    Simplicity
        Emphasize the simplest solution that works for the current problem
    Feedback
        Continuous feedback from testing, customers, and team members helps adjust the product
    Courage
        The team should be willing to embrace changes and make necessary, bold decisions
    Respect
        Team members should respect each other's contributions and abilities
```

### Key Practices

<Callout title='Key Practices of Extreme Programming (XP)'>
1. **Pair Programming**: Two developers work together at one workstation, enhancing code quality and team collaboration.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before writing code, ensuring every piece of code works as intended.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Frequently integrate code into the main branch to detect issues early.
4. **Small Releases**: Release working software frequently, often in small increments, to get feedback and improve based on customer needs.
5. **Refactoring**: Regularly improve and optimize code without changing its functionality.
6. **Sustainable Pace**: Avoid overworking the team to maintain a consistent and sustainable workflow.
7. **Collective Code Ownership**: Everyone on the team is responsible for all the code. This encourages collaboration and reduces silos.
8. **On-Site Customer**: Have someone from the customer side available to clarify requirements and provide immediate feedback.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="What's Agile?">
    - Project management methodology that emphasizes flexibility, rapid iteration, and customer satisfaction.
    - Defined by the 4 values and 12 principles of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How's Extreme Programming related to Agile?">
    Strong emphasis on the following common values:
    - Straightforward communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.
    - Highly iterative and incremental.
    - User-centric.
    - Encourage change, flexibility and adaptability
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How's Extreme Programming different from Agile?">
    - Extreme Programming is a software development methodology, while Agile is a project management methodology.
    - Strong emphasis on technical practices such as TDD, CI/CD, Pair Programming, and Documentation.
    - More prescriptive approach that applies principles the broader Agile framework.
