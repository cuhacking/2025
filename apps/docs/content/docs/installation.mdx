Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow.
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine.
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option.

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to switch to the dark side and code in shell?">
    No you don't. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.

## Clone [Repository](https://github.com/cuhacking/hackathon).

[GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) handles much of the authentication and other configuration for you.

View/make issues and pull requests from the terminal, and also access the project board.

```sh title="Nix Shell"
 # Login with your GitHub account.
 gh auth login -p=https -w
 gh repo fork cuhacking/2025 --clone
```

Provide the following answers.
```
? Where do you use GitHub? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> GitHub.com

? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> Yes

# Your one-time code will be different.
! First copy your one-time code: 95i2-DAE6
Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Return to the terminal when you see the `Congratulations, you're all set!` screen.

You should see the following:
```
✔ Authentication complete.
- gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
✔ Configured git protocol
✔ Logged in as YourGitHubUsername

  ## Run projects.

  <img src="https://nx.dev/documentation/shared/images/run-target-syntax.svg" />

Run all development servers.
```sh title="Nix Shell"
pnpm nx run-many -t dev --verbose
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```sh title="Nix Shell"
pnpm nx run-many -t dev -p website --verbose
```

`--verbose` provides detailed error logs.

<Callout type="warn" title="URLs may change as the project matures.">

If multiple apps are running or another server using that network port, your URLs may be different from someone else's and that's okay.

Always look at your terminal for the correct URL.
