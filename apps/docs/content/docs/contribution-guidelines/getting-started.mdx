## Something needs fixing? Want to add a new feature?

Creating an issue documents changes to incorporate and lets everyone know what you're working on.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's an issue?">
 A GitHub issue is essentially a task card that denotes **what** is being worked on, and by **whom**.

Issues also act as a discussion thread used to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements. Itâ€™s a way to collaborate with the community to solve problems and add enhancements.

Submit isses [here](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/issues).

[Here](https://github.com/cuhacking/2025/issues/49)'s an example of a well-documented issue.

Using a [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) Git porcelain  is highly encouraged to manage your commits, branches, staging areas, stashes, and much more. These are common occurences as we do [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

It's also significantly easier to resolve merge conflicts, cherry-pick commits between branches, squash them, amend a few commits back, checkout a specific commit, stage in hunks, etc.

You'll be able to unlock the full power of Git without having to memorize all the commands.

[Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is included in the Nix shell. Run `lazygit` in the Nix shell to use it.

<Accordion title="What's a Git Porcelain?">
In strict Git terminology, "porcelain" commands are high-level, user-friendly commands designed for everyday Git operations, such as `git commit`, `git merge`, and `git pull`. These are wrappers for low-level "plumbing" commands, that handle the internal data structures of Git, intended for scripting and advanced manipulation.

In this context, we mean tools such as [these](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) when we say "porcelain".

Porcelain commands simplify Git interaction by abstracting the complexities, making them ideal for regular use by developers.

## Learn the Fork and Pull Model

The [Fork and Pull Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models) is used to merge external contributions into the project.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's a fork?">
    Forking is creating a personal copy of a repository under your own GitHub account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project until youâ€™re ready to submit them.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Our codebase is constantly changing and evolving. Keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository with `gh repo sync cuhacking/2025`.

See [Knowledge Base - Learn Git](/knowledge-base#-learn-git) and  for resources.

## Check Project Status

See what we're up to on the project board linked in the navbar. <ProjectBoardIcon />

## Pick an Issue

Comment on an issue on the project board that you're interested in to be assigned, or create one for yourself.

Alternatively, you can also look at the open issues and see if there's anything that you can help with which interests you.

Make sure to let us know that you're interested in working on an issue by commenting on it.

## Create a Branch
Branch from `main` with the following name format:

`yourname/<issue-type>/<issue-number>-<issue-name-kebab-cased>`.

Your branch must be named the same as the issue, without the scopes.

For example, the branch for issue #1 titled 'feat(portal): add login page' would be:

`johndoe/feat/1-add-login-page`.

See [Conventional Branch](/conventional-branch) to learn more.

## Commit Changes with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec

See [Conventional Commits](/conventiona-commits) to learn more.
