Our branch naming convention modifies and extends the [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/) specification to be extremely straight-forward. It's simply the issue name without the scope.

Create a branch from `main` in the following format:
`yourname/<conventional-spec>/<issue-number>-<issue-name-kebab-cased>`.

For example, the branch for issue #1 titled 'feat(portal): add login page' would be: `johndoe/feat/1-add-login-page`.

<Callout type="error" title="Do not `git merge`">
This creates a merge commit unless you fast forward.

Instead, always pull the latest from `main`, check back out to your branch, then do `git rebase main`.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why don't we `git merge`?">
Trunk-Based Development keeps branches as short-lived as possible, and produces a clean, linear commit history; thus keeping cycle times to a minimum and reducing bugs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if the issue name is too long type out?">
Create them directly from the [issue page](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue), and it'll autofill the issue number and name for you in kebab-case.

Make sure to re-order and match the branch naming convention.

You'll often find yourself in situations where you need to work on multiple things at once, whether that be an urgent bug fix, helping someone else that's blocked, being blocked yourself, or shifting gears to a higher priority feature. Check out [Git Stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) for storing work in progress, and [Git Worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) for working on multiple branches at once.

If all of that sounded like gibberish to you, not to worry. Check out the [Learn Git](knowledge-base#-learn-git) section in our knowledge base.
