## What is Extreme Programming (XP)?

<Callout title='Extreme Programming (XP) is:'>
- A software development methodology
- Built on top of Agile development principles
- Advocates for frequent releases in short development cycles
- Emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Continuous Integration and Collective Code Ownership
</Callout>

### Core Principles of Extreme Programming (XP)

  root((Core Principles))
    Communication
        Constant and open communication between all  developers, designers, PMs and customers
    Simplicity
        Emphasize the simplest solution that works for the current problem
    Feedback
        Continuous feedback from testing, customers, and team members helps adjust the product
    Courage
        The team should be willing to embrace changes and make necessary, bold decisions
    Respect
        Team members should respect each other's contributions and abilities
``` 

### Key Practices of Extreme Programming (XP)

<Callout title='Key Practices of Extreme Programming (XP)'>
1. **Pair Programming**: Two developers work together at one workstation, enhancing code quality and team collaboration.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before writing code, ensuring every piece of code works as intended.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Frequently integrate code into the main branch to detect issues early.
4. **Small Releases**: Release working software frequently, often in small increments, to get feedback and improve based on customer needs.
5. **Refactoring**: Regularly improve and optimize code without changing its functionality.
6. **Sustainable Pace**: Avoid overworking the team to maintain a consistent and sustainable workflow.
7. **Collective Code Ownership**: Everyone on the team is responsible for all the code. This encourages collaboration and reduces silos.
8. **On-Site Customer**: Have someone from the customer side available to clarify requirements and provide immediate feedback.

    <Accordion title="What is Agile development?">
    - It's a project management methodology that emphasizes flexibility and customer satisfaction
    - It follows the Agile Manifesto (which outlines 4 values and 12 principles)
    - The principles behind the Agile Manifesto can be found [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How is Extreme Programming related to Agile?">
    - Both emphasizes values such as communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage
    - Both methodologies are iterative and incremental
    - Both methodologies are customer-centric
    - Both methodologies embrace change, flexibility and adaptability
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="How is Extreme Programming different from Agile?">
    - Extreme Programming is a software development methodology, while Agile is a project management methodology
    - Extreme Programming emphasizes technical practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, and Continuous Integration
    - Extreme Programming is a more prescriptive approach within the broader Agile framework
