Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow.
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine.
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option.

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why use WSL instead of switching to Linux?">
WSL allows you to:
- have the best of both worlds by running Linux and Windows simultaneously.
- Use Linux tools and commands directly from Windows without switching operating systems.
- Run various development environments smoothly without leaving your Windows OS.

You can still access the Windows filesystem from Linux and vice versa and avoid the hassle of dual booting.

[Why Dual booting on the same drive is not worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/risks-dual-booting-windows-linux-operating-systems/).
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to switch to the dark side and code in shell?">
    No you don't. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.
