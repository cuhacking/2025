        content: `**TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an MLH Member Event, if the event itself creates an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with an MLH representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.**

Major League Hacking (MLH) stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, violent depictions, vulgar language, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, MLH staff, and anyone else participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MLH may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact MLH using the reporting procedures defined below.

MLH representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, hackathon-related social events, hackathon-supplied transportation, and online interactions related to the event.

The Applications will be judged according to the following criteria:

0. originality/creativity (25%);
0. technical complexity (25%);
0. adherence to Theme (25%) and
0. practical implementation (25%).

The Application that earns the highest overall score at each Event or series of weekly Events will win. The decisions of the Judge will be final. Applications must abide by the hackathon rules set forth by the Event and Major League Hacking in the [Hackathon Rules] (https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/standard-hackathon-rules.md). In the event of a tie, the Judge will determine the winner at the Judge’s sole and final discretion. Each Participant or team must be available during the Event’s judging period to demonstrate the Participant’s or team’s Application. Judges may inspect Applications at any time during the judging period. The Sponsor may extend the judging period for any length of time, at the Sponsor’s discretion. If a judge or Participant identifies to the Sponsor a conflict of interest, that Judge will be recused from judging the Application with the conflict and an alternate Judge will be identified as a substitution for the recused Judge. Applications may be subject to a due diligence review at any time for eligibility and compliance with these Terms.

**Ownership of Applications:** Participant represents and warrants that the Application is and will be Participant’s own original work and does not and will not infringe the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any third-party patents, copyrights, or trademarks. Participant hereby agrees not to instigate, support, maintain or authorize any action, claim or lawsuit against the Sponsor, or any other person, on the grounds that any use of a Participant’s Application infringes any of Participant’s rights as the creator of the Application, including, without limitation, trademark rights, copyrights and moral rights or “droit moral.” Each Participant acknowledges and agrees that Sponsor or other Participants or third parties may have developed or commissioned works which are similar to the Application of Participant or Participant’s team, or may develop something similar in the future, and each Participant waives any claims that Participant may have resulting from any similarities to the Application of Participant or Participant’s team.

**Prizes and Awards:** The current prizes and awards are listed on https://hack.mlh.io/prizes.

The odds of winning depend on the total number of eligible Entries received. No cash or other substitution of prizes is permitted, except at the sole option of the Sponsor for a prize of equal or greater value. The Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes. Winners are solely responsible for any and all federal, state, provincial, and local taxes, if any, that apply to prizes.

Winners will be notified by the conclusion of each Event and may be required to sign and return an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release within seven (7) days of notification and if applicable will be issued a W-9 tax form. If a selected winner cannot be contacted, is ineligible, fails to claim a prize and/or where applicable an affidavit of eligibility and publicity/liability release is not received within seven (7) days, or if such affidavit is incomplete or modified, the prize may be forfeited and an alternate winner will be selected from remaining valid, eligible Applications submitted in a timely manner.

**Publicity:** Except where prohibited, by participating in the Contest, Participant consents to the use of his/her name, photo and/or likeness, biographical information, entry and statements attributed to Participant (if true) for advertising and promotional purposes, including without limitation, inclusion in Sponsor’ newsletters, Sponsor’ websites, and any of the Sponsor’s social media accounts or outlets without additional compensation.

**Indemnity:** You agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold Sponsor and their parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, Sponsor and agents, including advertising and promotion agencies, and assigns, and any other organizations related to the Contest, harmless, from any and all claims, injuries, damages, expenses or losses to person or property and/or liabilities of any nature that in any way arise from participation in the Contest or acceptance or use of a prize or parts thereof, including without limitation (i) any condition caused by events beyond Sponsor’ control that may cause the Contest to be disrupted or corrupted; (ii) any claim than an Application infringes third party intellectual property or proprietary rights; (iii) any disputes among team members, (iv) any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the prize, or acceptance, possession, or use of the prize, or from participation in the Contest; (v) any printing or typographical errors in any materials associated with the Contest; technical errors that may impair your ability to participate in the Contest; or (vi) errors in the administration of the Contest.

DISCLAIMER. IN NO EVENT WILL SPONSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CONTEST, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT SPONSOR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
