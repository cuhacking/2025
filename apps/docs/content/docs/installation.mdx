Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow.
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine.
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option.

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why use WSL instead of switching to Linux?">
WSL allows you to:
- have the best of both worlds by running Linux and Windows simultaneously.
- Use Linux tools and commands directly from Windows without switching operating systems.
- Run various development environments smoothly without leaving your Windows OS.

You can still access the Windows filesystem from Linux and vice versa and avoid the hassle of dual booting.

[Why Dual booting on the same drive is not worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/risks-dual-booting-windows-linux-operating-systems/).
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to switch to the dark side and code in shell?">
    No you don't. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.

Restart your machine for these changes to take effect.

After restart, launch 'Microsoft Store', and search 'Linux'.
