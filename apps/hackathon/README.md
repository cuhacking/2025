# cuHacking Hacker Portal

cuHacking is a hackathon organized by students at Carleton University. This project is a web application that serves as the portal for hackers to register for the hackathon, view the schedule, and submit their projects.

## Description

What we use:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Development Setup

### 1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) provides a nice UI.

### 2. Install [ Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

### 3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
# or
pnpm install
```

### 5. Create `.env` File

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables.

You will need to set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a random string.
We recommend using a password generator to create a secure secret or you can use the following command to generate a random string:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

You will also need to set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` if you want to enable Google OAuth.

There is information about how to install Google OAuth credentials in the [Additional Setup](#additional-setup) section.

### 6. Run PostgreSQL in Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
```

<small>**Note:** If you have a local PostgreSQL server running, you may need to stop it before running the Docker container.</small>

<small>**Note:** You can also build and run the app itself with Docker by running `docker-compose up -d --build`.</small>

### 7. Run Prisma Migrate

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

### 8. Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Happy hacking! ðŸš€

## Additional Setup

### Google OAuth

To enable Google OAuth, you'll need to create a project in the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and create OAuth credentials.

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and create a new project.

2. Go to the "Credentials" tab and click "Create credentials" > "OAuth client ID".

3. Select "Web application" as the application type.

4. Add `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback/google` as an authorized redirect URI.

5. Copy the client ID and client secret into your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

6. Restart the development server.

You should now be able to sign in with Google.
